# fitness-goals
Fitness Goals is a full front-end responsive website (without frameworks used) build with HTML, CSS and Javascript which allows users to visualize their dream physique.

I have used the CSS Bootstrap frameworkâ€™s media queries and flex-box feature for implementing responsive web design and implementing better UI/UX in an easy-to-use website. I have used Javascript nested functions to implement the business logic for calculating the BMI on the home page and the Regex input matching function for input validation on the sign-in/sign-up page. User input on the Services page is verified by using JSON format for data interchange and displaying it to DOM.
