                    Your physical appearance is the first and foremost characteristic to make an impactful impression when 
                    people first meet you. Fitness is an aspect necessary to achieve, not only for gaining your desired outer 
                    look but also to stay healthy and avoid a long- term diseases like High Cholesterol, diabetes, cancer, etc.
                    There are three types of fitness to choose from depending on your goals: <span class="bg-lightgrey">Aerobic fitness, Muscle strengthening 
                    and flexibility.</span> Each of these categories has many exercises which you can perform. But first thing's 
                    first. You need to know your BMI (Body Mass Index). This factor will help you determine if you are underweight, 
                    overweight, healthy or obese. <br><br>
                    Please use the given BMI calculator to set your workout goals.

                <h2>Aerobic Fitness</h2>
                <p>
                    Aerobic activities condition your heart and lungs. Aerobic means "with oxygen." The purpose of aerobic 
                    conditioning is to increase the amount of oxygen that is delivered to your muscles, which allows them 
                    to work longer. Any activity that raises your heart rate and keeps it up for an extended period of time 
                    will improve your aerobic conditioning.<br><br>
                    Some of the aerobic exercise includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Swimming</li>
                    <li>Cycling</li>
                    <li>Walking</li>
                    <li>Rowing</li>
                    <li>Running</li>
                    <li>Jumping rope</li>
                    <li>Step aerobics</li>
                 </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>Muscle strengthening</h2>
                <img src="images/Muscle strengthning.jpg">

            <div>
                <p>
                    Stronger muscles can mean either more powerful muscles that can do bigger jobs (such as lifting 
                    heavier weights) or muscles that will work longer before becoming exhausted (endurance). Weight 
                    training (resistance training) or simple exercises such as push-ups are two examples of ways to 
                    focus on muscle strengthening.<br><br>
                    Some of the muscle strengthning exercise includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Squats</li>
                    <li>Push-Ups</li>
                    <li>Pull-Ups</li>
                    <li>Biceps Curl</li>
                    <li>Triceps Pulldown</li>
                    <li>Planks</li>
                    <li>Deadlifts</li>
                 </ul>

                <h2>Flexibility</h2>
                <p>
                    Like aerobic fitness and muscle strengthening, flexibility is a result of physical activity. 
                    Flexibility comes from stretching. Your muscles are repeatedly shortened when they are used, 
                    especially when exercising. They need to be slowly and regularly stretched to counteract the 
                    repeated shortening that happens through other activities.<br><br>
                    Some of the flexibility exercise includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yoga</li>
                    <li>Split Squat</li>
                    <li>Seated hamstring stretch</li>
                    <li>Shoulder stretch</li>
                    <li>The forward hang</li>
                    <li>Butterfly Groin stretch</li>
                    <li>Lunges</li>
                 </ul>
